Project-3 --> An online dex

This is my third project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

The project theme is an online dictionary where you can search for unknown word or simply look in the list of words that this dictionary currently has registered.
You can add new words to the dictionary, edit the current ones or if you want you can even delete them.
